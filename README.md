# FEEDREADER PROJECT
Testing is an important prerequisite for development of properly functional programming products; from good websites to systems software and applications and hence it must be included every time one is doing development. Tests help to make the development projects maintain their properties and be authentic. This is refered to as **Test Driven Development (TDD)**.
## JASMINE TESTING FRAMEWORK
Jasmine testing framework is an open source JavaScript framework that can be run on any JavaScript platform for testing JavaScript code. It is clean, has obvious syntax, is behavior driven and does not depend on any another framework.
An illustration of the **Behavior Driven Development** nature of Jasmine is as shown. This image was obtained  from [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jasminejs/jasminejs_bdd_architecture.htm)
